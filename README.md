# ToDoAPI
This tutorial teaches the basics of building a web API with ASP.NET Core. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

* Create a web API project.
* Add a model class.
* Create the database context.
* Register the database context.
* Add a controller.
* Add CRUD methods.
* Configure routing and URL paths.
* Specify return values.
* Call the web API with Postman.
* Call the web API with jQuery.

At the end, you have a web API that can manage "to-do" items stored in a relational database.
